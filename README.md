## About DOM Behind

We want to separate View and ViewModel.

There are many MVVM solutions in the Web, but many think that observable objects are paying attention to transferring data to View.
Although it is a useful function, it is not the essence of MVVM.

In a presentation layer where information such as business logic and view objects intersect, we want to separate responsibilities on a component basis.


The aim is on the principle of single responsibility.
Creating code that fulfills a single responsibility principle is not painful, as it is not the purpose of reducing the amount of code.

In the world of XAML, it was able to respond flexibly.
That's because the idea for describing code for View such as dependency properties and code-behind has been established


We are still under development. We will continue to strengthen the guide on more useful features and usage.
